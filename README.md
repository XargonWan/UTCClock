# UTCClock

## Intro

I just wanted to see UTC time on my GNOME Shell desktop,
[just as mibus did](https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock).

## Install

### Automatic

Go to https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1183/utcclock/ and turn on the extension.

### Manual

```
git clone https://github.com/injcristianrojas/UTCClock.git
cd UTCClock
make install
```

Depending if you have Wayland or not, you will have to log out and then log back in.

This method is good if you don't want to wait for GNOME Extensions approval.
