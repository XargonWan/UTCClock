# UTCClock

## Intro

I just wanted to see UTC time on my GNOME Shell desktop,
[just as mibus did](https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock).

## Install

### Automatic

Go to https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1183/utcclock/ and turn on the extension.

### Manual

```
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/injcristianrojas/UTCClock.git utcclock@injcristianrojas.github.com
```

## TODO

* Test it in other versions of the GNOME Shell platform.
* Make it use different texts (i.e. "22:00 UTC/Zulu", "22:00 GMT", etc.)
* Make it configurable for showing seconds or not.
